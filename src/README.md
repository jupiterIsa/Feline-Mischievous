Description:
	This project is a mini platformer game where you play as a gray cat. The objective is to get as many points as you can in 10 seconds. You do this by destroying money objects with mouse left click. You can gain more time by earning points. But if you run out of time or fall off the platforms, the your points and time reset. In the repository there is this file to give information about my project, the actual project.py file that includes all of my code, a proposal.md file that has my project proposal and my plan for what progress I'd make each week, and there is also a folder called "Sprites" that has all of my source images for this project.
	
    Some design considerations with my project I made was the actual art style. To keep it simple and not too time consuming, I made my own cat sprite in a pixel art software called
    Asperite, and found the other resources for free online. I chose packs that were more muted in colors, as I didn't want my game to be oversaturated and colorful. Some future areas of improvements would be fixing the collisions on the cat so it isn't floating in the air and adding sound effects.
	
    A lot of this project was searching through forums, documentations, and tutorials to find ways to implement the mechanics that I wanted. In the end, I'm very happy with how it turned out, and learned quite a bit with this project.
