\## Description A simple 2D platformer where you control a cat that
destroys objects, the goal is to destroy as many items possible within a
certain amount of time. This relates to the subject as it will be a game
and that itself is a digital art.

\## Features - Jumping  - Use a for loop and if statement to see if
spacebar in being pressed - Gravity/Collisions  - For loop checking
every tick if the cat is on the ground or not which would in turn
start/stop gravity - Destroying objects for points  - If statement and
for loop to see if object is being touched

\## Challenges - Jumping between platforms and using spacebar as the
button - Falling results in death/restart - The button to break objects
and how it results to give the player points

platforms and death if they fall
